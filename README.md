# pedestrian-counting-with-mobilenet_ssd
In this Repository, I use the mobilenet_sdd model to count people and all the sources I get from pyimagesearch I definitely modified some of their code to get the appropriate outcome.

I use a virtual raspberry pi to configure the whole project and I also tried with wireless camera option as my smartphone with android application [IP webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en_CA).
